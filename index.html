		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<img id="profilepic" src="assets/images/Mark1.jpg" alt="Picture of Mark">

		<p>My name is Mark Sedlazek. I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I hope to incorporate visual design and artistic creativity to the development field, creating unique and captivating designs that will not only attract users but also break the boundaries of what the internet is supposed to look like.</p>

		<br>

		<p>While I am new to the field of Web Development, I have many hobbies and experience in different fields that influence who I am and how I operate. I enjoy art of all types and am an artist as well. I enjoy creating portraits using charcoal as well as pencil. I am a sketch artist, and also enjoy miniature figurine painting. Which brings me to another area of hobbies, gaming. </p>

		<br>

		<p>I am an avid gamer of all types, but primarily tabletop and live action role playing. I aspire to write my own game systems as well as modules for already popular games such as 'Dungeons And Dragons' and 'Shadowrun'. I am also aspiting to create my own system for live action play that involves physical combat as well as heavy costuming and high production values. To sum it up, I enjoy creating unique worlds and scenarios for other to negotiate and enjoy.</p>

		<br>

		<p>In short, I am simply a person who is trying to learn as much as he can and try to make an impact on the world in whatever ways I can. The question is, are you looking to make an impact? If so, I can help!</p>
